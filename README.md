## Usage

1. Connect to the dapp using a web3 provider such as MetaMask.
2. Enter the receiving address and the amount of ETH to send.
3. Press the "Send" button to initiate the transaction.

## Note

You must have a sufficient balance in your account to pay for the transaction's gas fees.

Always a good practice to double check the address you are sending the funds to before making a transaction.

Users are responsible for any fees incurred by the Ethereum network.

## Development

This dapp is built using JavaScript and the Ethers.js library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

It is designed as a single-file application. The `index.html` file contains all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
